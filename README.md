Example of how to use:

1. Create a directory called "wp-plugins". 
2. Put your plugin git and svn repos there. Make sure they have the same base 
name but differ by the ending, eg:

  wp-https-domain-alias.git/
  wp-https-domain-alias.svn/

3. Copy this script there
4. Run the script to sync from git to svn
